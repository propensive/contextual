__Contextual__ makes it simple to write typesafe, statically-checked interpolated strings.

Contextual is a Scala library which allows you to define your own string interpolators—prefixes for
interpolated string literals like `url"https://propensive.com/"`—which specify how they should be checked
at compiletime and interpreted at runtime, writing very ordinary user code with no user-defined macros.
